This repository contains a collection of JavaScript coding challenges that are designed to help you improve your skills and test your knowledge of the language. Each challenge is accompanied by a README file that explains the problem statement, input/output, and any additional requirements.

The answers will be available in /solutions/problem_title/answer.js while the explanation will be given in /solutions/problem_title/readme.md.

## Challenge 1: FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead of the number and for the multiples of five, print "Buzz". For numbers which are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz". For example, your program should print:

```javascript
 1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz
16
...
```

## Challenge 2: Palindrome Checker

Create a function that takes a string as an argument and returns `true` if it's a palindrome and `false` if it's not. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward. For example, "racecar" is a palindrome, but "hello" is not.
